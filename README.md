# Security in Node.js from Theory to Practice - An educational journey through hands-on case studies

Case studies and resources created while working with the thesis.
Current repos contains code related to three separate case studies.
1) Serverside code injection (eval)
2) CSRF
3) NoSQLi for authentication bypass

##### Future work
* Improve code quality
* Dockerize it to simplify installation. 
* Add some frontend design for possible CTF 

Finally, possibly add collection of resources used while doing the work.
